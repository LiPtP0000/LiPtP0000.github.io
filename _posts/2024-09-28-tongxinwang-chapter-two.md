This is a note for the Southeast University course *"Communication Networks and Technologies"* taught by Prof. Wang. In this post I will mark down the basic concepts of the communication network, multiplexing techniques and channel coding.

# Overview of the Communication Network Principles
There are  **four main parts** of the communication network:
1. Terminal
2. Transmission (Channel coding, Multiplexing, etc.)
3. Switching
4. Protocol

Now let's go through each part in detail.
## Terminal

{: .box-note}
Terminal is the *end point* of the communication network. For example, a cell phone, a computer, a printer, etc. are all terminals.

In the terminal, there are two main **services**:
1. Information Service (Terminal Service): Provided on the terminal, such as text messaging, email, voice messaging, etc. It is based on the **Network Service** (Bearer Service) provided by the network.

2. Network Service (Bearer Service): Data transfer from one place to another provided by *the network*, usually via UNI (User Network Interface).
