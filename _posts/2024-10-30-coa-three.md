# Chapter 12: Machine Instruction Characteristics

## Elements of a machine instruction

The elements of a machine instruction are:

- **Operation Code**: a binary code that specifies the operation to be performed.
- **Source operands reference**: source operands that are involved in the operation.
- **Result operands reference**: result produced by the operation.
- **Next instruction reference**: tells the processor where to **fetch the next instruction** after the instruction is executed.

Source and result operands can be in **memory**, **registers**, **I/O devices**, or **immediate values**.

Here's a diagram of a machine executing an instruction:

In the diagram we can find that: both the source operands and the result operands should be addressed by "Operand address calculation".

## Instruction representation

**In machine code each instruction has a unique bit pattern.** But for programmers each instruction has a symbolic representation, like ADD, SUB, AND, OR, etc. These symbolic representations are called **mnemonics**.(助记符)

Here's a diagram of common mnemonics in **IAS Structure** (_Mentioned in Ch1_):

| Mnemonic |       Operation       |
| :------: | :-------------------: |
| **ADD**  |       Addition        |
| **SUB**  |      Subtraction      |
| **MUL**  |    Multiplication     |
| **DIV**  |       Division        |
| **LOAD** | Load Data from memory |
| **STOR** | Store Data to memory  |

A typical 16-bit **instruction format** is:

`Opcode [4 bits]| Operand Reference[6 bits] | Operand Reference[6 bits]`

High level languages are mostly first translated into machine code, and then it could be executed by the processor.

{: .box-note}
Some compiler can directly translate high level language into machine code, like `g++` or `clang`, but some compilers first translate it into **Assembly language** and then into machine code. While languages like **Python** uses a explainer instead of a compiler, so it doesn't need to be translated into machine code.这是一个坑！！

## Instruction type

Like the concept of **_Structure Function_**, in Chapter 1, the instruction type can be separated into 4 categories (with Assembly instructions for example):

- **Data Processing**: Arithmetic and logic instructions. (ADD, SUB, AND, OR, etc.)
- **Data Storage**: Movement of data into or out of register and or memory locations.(MOV, STO, LOD, etc.)
- **Data Movement**: I/O instructions. (IN, OUT, etc.)
- **Control**: **_Test_** and **_branch_** instructions. (JMP, JC, etc.)

## Number of addresses

## Instruction set design
