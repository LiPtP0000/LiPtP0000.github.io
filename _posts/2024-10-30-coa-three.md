# Chapter 12: Machine Instruction Characteristics

## Elements of a machine instruction

The elements of a machine instruction are:

- **Operation Code**: a binary code that specifies the operation to be performed.
- **Source operands reference**: source operands that are involved in the operation.
- **Result operands reference**: result produced by the operation.
- **Next instruction reference**: tells the processor where to **fetch the next instruction** after the instruction is executed.

Source and result operands can be in **memory**, **registers**, **I/O devices**, or **immediate values**.

Here's a diagram of a machine executing an instruction:

In the diagram we can find that: both the source operands and the result operands should be addressed by "Operand address calculation".

## Instruction representation

**In machine code each instruction has a unique bit pattern.** But for programmers each instruction has a symbolic representation, like ADD, SUB, AND, OR, etc. These symbolic representations are called **mnemonics**.(助记符)

A typical 16-bit **instruction format** is: `Opcode [4 bits]| Operand Reference[6 bits] | Operand Reference[6 bits]`

## Instruction type

## Number of addresses

## Instruction set design
