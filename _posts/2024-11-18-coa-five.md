This is a summary note of the course "Computer Organization and Architecture" by Professor _William Stallings_.

The remaining contents are organized as:

- Chapter 14
    - Processor Organization
    - Register Organization
    - Instruction Cycle
    - Pipelining

# Chapter 14: Processor Structure and Function

## Processor Organization

First consider the *requirements* of the processor (or CPU, **C**entral **P**rocessing **U**nit).

- Fetch Instruction (FI)
- Interpret Instruction (DI)
- Fetch Data (FO)
- Process Data (CO, EI)
- Write Data (WO)

A processor builds interconnection with **system bus**. Typically, it contains *Control Bus*, *Data Bus*, and *Address Bus*. Inside the CPU, there are **Registers**, **ALU**, and **Control Unit** with control paths and a *Internal Processor Bus* to construct interconnection.


## Register Organization

{:.box-success}
At higher levels of the hierarchy, memory is faster, smaller, and more expensive - From *Memory Hierarchy*.

Registers are temporal storage in the processor. The level of register is higher than main memory and cache. There are mainly two register roles in the processor:

### User Visible Registers

{:.box-note}
Registers that enable **machine or programmer** to deploy in order to minimize the main memory references.

There are four main types of user-visible registers (however they are not clearly seperated):

- General Purpose (通用寄存器)
- Address
- Data
- Condition Codes, or *flags*

`True General-purpose regs` contain ***any operand for any opcode***. However in most cases these regs are dedicated to floating-point regs or stack regs. The number of GP regs range from 8 to 32. 

- Fewer number of GP regs increases memory references 
- More GP regs doesn't reduce memory referfences and take up more processor real estate(占用空间)

`Data regs` only hold data, while cannot be referenced in calculation of the address.

`Address regs` may be devoted to a specific address mode, which can be catagorized as:

- Stack pointer (For *Stack Addressing*)
- Index register (For *Autoindexing* or *Index addressing*)
- Segment Pointers (For system with segments)

`Condition Codes` are set of individual bits. They usually **cannot** be modified by programs.

Typical condition codes include:

- Sign
- Zero Flag
- Carry Flag
- Equal
- Overflow
- Interrupt Enable
- Supervisor: Allows **privileged instructions** to execute, not available to user programs
- etc.

They are more often appeared in PSWs.

Pros and Cons:

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
| :--------: | :-----------: |
| Reduced the number of `Compare` or `TEST` Commands | Add complexity to hardware and software |
| Conditional instructions are simplified | Require additional hdw connection |
| Easy to implement multiple branches | Need additional conditional-code-support instruction |
| Can be saved on stack | In pipelined implementation, it needs extra sync process |

{:.box-note}
*The register size is designed to hold a full address or word considering its type. Computers often permits **combining** two registers as one to use, such as type `long long` and `long double`.*

### Control and Status Registers 

{:.box-note}
Used by **Control Unit** to *control* the behavior of the processor, and by privileged operating system to *control* the execution of programs.

- PC: Program Counter, *point to the address of next instruction*.
- IR: Instruction Register, *contains instruction, not connected to any bus*
- MAR: Memory Address Register, *contains memory address, connected to address bus*
- MBR: Memory Buffer Register, *contains data, connected to data bus*

- Program Status Word (PSW): A or a set of regs containing status information *involving condition code*

## Instruction Cycle

A instruction cycle includes:

1. Fetch
2. Execute
3. Interrupt
4. Indirect

They are not sequentially organized, but interconnected.

In actual instruction cycle, there will be an **interruption check** during operand storage and next instruction fetch process in the diagram below.

### Data flow

In this part we will show the data flow of **Fetch**, **Indirect** and **Interrupt** process, as **execution** process requires no data flow in the processor.

## Pipelining

### Six-stage pipeline for CPU

Here's a six-stage pipelined CPU operating diagram. Note that **unconditional branch** refers to operations like `JMP AX` which require no full instruction operated. **Branches and Interrupts** can contain conditions, like `JNZ AX`.

{:.box-note}
Every pipeline flush occurs **after** the `CO` or `EI` process has been done.

### Pipeline performance

Two main factors: **Time** and **Speed-up Factor**.

| Alphabet | Meaning | Formula |
| :------: | :------: | :------: |
| $$d$$ | time delay of a latch | / |
| $$\tau$$ | The time needed to advance a set of instructions **one stage** through the pipeline | $$\tau = \tau_{max} + d$$|
| $$T_{k,n}$$ | The **total time** required for a pipeline with *k* stages to execute *n* instructions | $$ T_{k,n} = (k + n - 1)\tau $$
| $$S_k$$ | Speedup factor for the instruction pipeline compared to execution without the pipeline | $$S_k = \frac{nk}{k + n - 1}$$ |
