This is a summary note of the course "Computer Organization and Architecture" by Professor _William Stallings_.

The remaining contents are organized as:

- Chapter 14
    - Processor Organization
    - Register Organization
    - Instruction Cycle
    - Pipelining

# Chapter 14: Processor Structure and Function

## Processor Organization

First consider the *requirements* of the processor (or CPU, **C**entral **P**rocessing **U**nit).

- Fetch Instruction (FI)
- Interpret Instruction (DI)
- Fetch Data (FO)
- Process Data (CO, EI)
- Write Data (WO)

A CPU builds interconnection with **system bus**. Typically, it contains *Control Bus*, *Data Bus*, and *Address Bus*. Inside the CPU, there are **Registers**, **ALU**, and **Control Unit** with control paths and a *Internal Processor Bus* to construct interconnection.

## Instruction Cycle

## Pipelining
