# Chapter 4 (Part II): Elements of Cache Design

## Cache Addresses

There are some concepts:

1. Virtual Memory: Virtual memory is a technique that allows programs to run without running out of physical memory. It works by mapping the virtual memory addresses to physical memory addresses.
2. Hardware Memory Management Unit (MMU): The MMU is a hardware device that translates virtual memory addresses to physical memory addresses. It is inserted **between Processor and Main Memory.**
3. Logical Cache is located between the MMU and **the processor**.
4. Physical Cache is located between the MMU and **the main memory**.

## Cache Size

{: .box-success}
_We would like the size of the cache to be small enough so that the overall average cost per bit is close to that of main memory alone and large enough so that the overall average access time is close to that of the cache alone._

## Mapping Function

a means is needed for determining which **main memory block** currently occupies a cache
line. The choice of the mapping function dictates how the cache is organized.

So there are three main mapping functions:

### DIRECT MAPPING: _Each block in main memory is mapped to a single cache line._

The corresponding way is:

$$i = j \, mod \,m$$

where **m** is the number of cache lines and **j** is the main memory block number. Here is an example:

<br/>
    ![Direct Mapping](/assets/img/COA-images/Direct-Mapping.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}
    <br/>

{: .box-success}
_When a block is actually read into its assigned line, it is necessary to **tag** the data to distinguish it from other blocks that can fit into that line._

There are some figures to remember. Note that we will specify **s** as the length of the tag and line, **r** as the line size, and **w** as the bits of the word.

1. Address length = (s+w) bits, where the **most significant s bits** specify a memory block, while the **least significant w bits** specify a word within the block.
2. Number of addressable units = $$2^{s+w}$$ words. （可寻址单元）
3. Block size = Line size = $$2^w$$ words.（因为是直接映射，故肯定是相同的）
4. Number of blocks in main memory = $$2^{s}$$.
5. Number of cache lines = m = $$2^r$$.
6. size of tag = s-r bits.

It is very easy to implement, but it leads to fixed cache location for any given block. Thus, when two blocks are mapped to the same cache line, they will be evicted together.

### ASSOCIATIVE MAPPING: _Each block in main memory is mapped to ANY cache line._

It overcomes the disadvantage of direct mapping by permitting each main memory block to be loaded into any line of the cache. In this way, a main memory address can be interpreted as only **tag** and **word**.

- Now the main memory address is divided into **22 bits of tag** and **2 bits of word.** by cache control logic.

There are some figures to remember. Note that we will specify **s** as the length of the tag ~~and line~~, ~~r as the line size~~, and **w** as the bits of the word.

1. Address length = (s+w) bits, where the **most significant s bits** specify a memory block, while the **least significant w bits** specify a word within the block.
2. Number of addressable units = $$2^{s+w}$$ words. （可寻址单元）
3. Block size = Line size = $$2^w$$ words.（因为是直接映射，故肯定是相同的）
4. Number of blocks in main memory = $$2^{s}$$.
5. Number of cache lines = m = ~~$$2^r$$~~ UNDETERMINED.
6. size of tag = s bits.

### SET-ASSOCIATIVE MAPPING: _A Compromise between Direct and Associative Mapping._

Now the cache includes multiple **sets** consisting of multiple cache lines. The cache control logic interprets the main memory address as **s-d** bits of tag, **d** bits of set number and **w** bits of word.
<br/>
![Set-Associative Mapping](/assets/img/COA-images/set-associative.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}
<br/>

1. Address length = (s+w) bits, where the **most significant s bits** specify a memory block, while the **least significant w bits** specify a word within the block.
2. Number of addressable units = $$2^{s+w}$$ words. （可寻址单元）
3. Block size = Line size = $$2^w$$ words.（代表了 Main memory 中 Block 的存贮大小，进而直接对应了 Cache 中的 Line 存贮信息的大小）
4. Number of blocks in main memory = $$2^{s}$$.
5. Number of cache lines = m = ~~$$2^r$$~~ UNDETERMINED.
6. size of tag = s bits.

# Review Questions

## Questions

{: .box-note}
**Question 4.5**:Consider a 32-bit microprocessor that has an on- chip 16-kB four-way set-associative cache. Assume that the cache has a line size of four 32-bit words. Draw a block diagram of this cache showing its organization and how the different address fields are used to determine a cache hit/miss. Where in the cache is the word from memory location ABCDE8F8 mapped?

**Answer:**
The line size is 16 bytes (4 words). To address a byte in a 16-byte line, we need 4 bits for the word. There are 256 sets. To address a set, we need 8 bits for the index. The remaining bits in the 32-bit address will be used for the tag, so there are 32 − 8 − 4 = 20 tag bits.

Hex: ABCDE8F8 = 10101011110011011110 10001111 1000 (Binary).Therefore, the word from memory location ABCDE8F8 is mapped to Set 232, and within that set, it will be stored in one of the 4 lines based on the tag comparison.

{: .box-note}
**Question 4.6**: Given the following specifications for an external cache memory: four-way set associative; line size of two 16-bit words; able to accommodate a total of 4K 32-bit words from main memory; used with a 16-bit processor that issues 24-bit addresses. Design the cache structure with all pertinent information and show how it interprets the processor’s addresses.

**Answer:**
Total cache size is calculated as a division of **cache size** and **cache line size**, which is 4K lines.
With a four-way set associative, Number of Sets can be calculated as:

$$\frac{\text{Total Cache Lines}}{\text{Asscociativity}} = 1024 \,\text{Sets}$$

As for the 24-bit address, it is seperated into 12 bits of tag, 10 bits of set number, and 2 bits of word. Therefore, the cache structure is as same as 4.5, but with 1024 sets instead of 256 sets.

{: .box-note}
**Question 4.7**:The Intel 80486 has an on-chip, unified cache. It contains 8 kB and has a four-way set-associative organization and a block length of four 32-bit words. The cache is organized into 128 sets. There is a single “line valid bit” and three bits, B0, B1, and B2 (the “LRU” bits), per line. On a cache miss, the 80486 reads a 16-byte line from main memory in a bus memory read burst. Draw a simplified diagram of the cache and show how the different fields of the address are interpreted.

**Answer:**

**Address Breakdown:**

- **Tag**: 21 bits
- **Set**: 7 bits
- **Word**: 4 bits

**Line Structure:**
Different from normal cache line, it includes 21 bits of tag and a single “line valid bit” and three bits, B0, B1, and B2 (the “LRU” bits), and 16 bytes of data. Note that only when the line valid bit is 1, the content of the line is valid.

**Question 4.8**:Consider a machine with a byte addressable main memory of 64K bytes and block size of 8 bytes. Assume that a **direct-mapped cache consisting of 32 lines** is used with the machine. Answer the following questions:

{: .box-note}

- How is a 16-bit memory address divided into tag, line, and byte number?
- Into what line would bytes with each of the following addresses be stored in the cache?
  - `0001 0001 0001 1011`
  - `1100 0011 0011 0100`
  - `1101 0000 0001 1101`
  - `1010 1010 1010 1010`
- Suppose the byte with address `0001 1010 0001 1010` is stored in the cache, what are the addresses of other bytes stored along with it in the cache?
- How many total bytes of memory can be stored in the cache?
- Why is the tag also stored in the cache?

**Answer:**

**Question A**:The 16-bit memory address is divided into tag, line, and byte number as follows:

- Tag: 8 bits
- Line: 5 bits
- Byte: 3 bits

**Question B**:The bytes with the given addresses would be stored in the following lines in the cache:

- `0001 0001 0001 1011`: Line 3
- `1100 0011 0011 0100`: Line 6
- `1101 0000 0001 1101`: Line 3
- `1010 1010 1010 1010`: Line 21

**Question C**:The byte with address `0001 1010 0001 1010` is stored in the cache, and the other bytes stored along with it in the cache are:

- `0001 1010 0001 1000`
- `0001 1010 0001 1001`
- `0001 1010 0001 1010`(self)
- `0001 1010 0001 1011`
- `0001 1010 0001 1100`
- `0001 1010 0001 1101`
- `0001 1010 0001 1110`
- `0001 1010 0001 1111`

**Question D**:The total number of bytes that can be stored in the cache is:

$$\text{Total Bytes} = \text{Number of Lines} \times \text{Line Size}$$

In this case, the number of lines is 32, and the line size is 8 bytes. Therefore, the total number of bytes that can be stored in the cache is:

$$32 \times 8 = 256 \text{ bytes}$$

**Question E**: The tag is also stored in the cache, for distinguishing between different blocks that are mapped to the same cache line.
