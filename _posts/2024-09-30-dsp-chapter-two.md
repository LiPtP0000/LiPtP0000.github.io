We have already discussed about **discrete time signals** in chapter one. However, they are generally originated from analog signals. In this chapter, we will first introduce the concept of **sampling** and **rebuilding** of analog signals, and then discuss about the **Nyquist frequency** and **aliasing**. Finally, we will learn about the filters and the concepts of **undersampling** and **oversampling**.
