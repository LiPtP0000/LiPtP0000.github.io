# Chapter 1
## Concepts

Now we will introduce the basic concepts of the course. All the contents in the future chapters will be based on these concepts.

1. **Computer Architecture**: *Attributes* visible to a programmer, or attributes *have a direct impact on the execution* of a program.
2. **Organization**: *Operational units and their interconnections* that realize the architectural specifications.
3. **Structure**: The way in which the components are *interrelated*.
    - Top level structure of the computer:

    - Major Elements of a **Multi-core Computer**:

    - CPU Structure:
        - Control Unit (CU): *Controls the operation of the CPU*.
        - Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU): *Performs arithmetic and logical operations*.
        - Registers internal to the CPU: *Hold intermediate results*.
        - CPU Interconnections
4. **Function**: *The operation* of each individual component as part of a strucutre.
    - Main functions:
        - Movement
        - Storage
        - Control (星形结构的中心)
        - Processing

## History of Computer Evolution
- Vacuum tubes: **IAS Structure**
- Transistors: Add *data channels* to process I/O instructions.
- Integrated circuits: Add Gates and Cells to process digital signals, with the use of *Multiplexor*.
- VLSI, ULSI, Microprocessors

# Chapter 2
## Strive for performance!
There are 3 major ways for achieving high performance in the current workflow.
1. **Microprocessor Speed**, by *pipelining* and *Branch Prediction*,etc.
2. **Performance Balance**, by *tuning the COA to compensate for the mismach between capabilities of the components*.
3. **Improvement in COA directly**: by enhancing the hardware speed of the processor, improving the *size and speed* of the caches, or even change the overall structure of the processor.
