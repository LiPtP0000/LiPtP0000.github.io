# Chapter 1
## Concepts

Now we will introduce the basic concepts of the course. All the contents in the future chapters will be based on these concepts.

1. **Computer Architecture**: *Attributes* visible to a programmer, or attributes *have a direct impact on the execution* of a program.
2. **Organization**: *Operational units and their interconnections* that realize the architectural specifications.
3. **Structure**: The way in which the components are *interrelated*.
    - Top level structure of the computer:

    <br/>
    - Major Elements of a **Multi-core Computer**:

    <br/>
    - CPU Structure:
        - Control Unit (CU): *Controls the operation of the CPU*.
        - Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU): *Performs arithmetic and logical operations*.
        - Registers internal to the CPU: *Hold intermediate results*.
        - CPU Interconnections
4. **Function**: *The operation* of each individual component as part of a strucutre.
    - Main functions:
        - Movement
        - Storage
        - Control (星形结构的中心)
        - Processing

## History of Computer Evolution
- Vacuum tubes: **IAS Structure**
- Transistors: Add *data channels* to process I/O instructions.
- Integrated circuits: Add Gates and Cells to process digital signals, with the use of *Multiplexor*.
- VLSI, ULSI, Microprocessors

# Chapter 2
## Strive for performance!
There are 3 major ways for achieving high performance in the current workflow.
1. **Microprocessor Speed**, by *pipelining* and *Branch Prediction*,etc.
2. **Performance Balance**, by *tuning the COA to compensate for the mismach between capabilities of the components*.
3. **Improvement in COA directly**: by enhancing the hardware speed of the processor, improving the *size and speed* of the caches, or even change the overall structure of the processor.

# Chapter 4
## Computer Memory System
The complex subject of computer memory is made more manageable if we classify it according to its **characteristics**.

Here are the main characteristics of computer memory. Note that they are only a part of the whole picture.

{: .box-note}
- Overview of the Major Characteristics of Computer Memory System:<br/>
    - Location
    - Capacity
    - Unit of Transfer
    - Access Method
    - Performance
    - Physical Type
    - Physical Characteristics
    - Organization

Now we will move on to the details of each characteristic.

1. **Location**
There are many different types of memory locations, but generally it can be classified into two types:
    - *Internal Memory*, including main memory, cache, internal memories at processor and control units, etc.
    - *External Memory*, consists of peripheral storage devices, such as disk and tape, that are accessible to the processor via I/O controllers.
2. **Capacity**
 Measured in *bytes* or *words*, according to the type of memory. The concept of *word* will soon be introduced.
3. **Unit of Transfer**

{: .box-warning}
这里有几个概念需要区分：*word*,*address unit*,*unit of transfer*.<br/>对于*Word*,是最基础的存储单元，一般是32bit或者64bit。**不确定和“32位系统”里的概念是否等同**。<br/>对于*Address unit*，很多系统已经支持按位寻址，即地址是以字节为单位的，所以地址单元就是一个字节。但是，有的系统支持按字寻址，即地址是以字为单位的，所以地址单元就是一个字。<br/>对于*Unit of transfer*，一般和外部设备交换是以*block*为单位的，可以一次读取多个字。
