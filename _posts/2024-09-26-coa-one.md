# Chapter 1

## Concepts

Now we will introduce the basic concepts of the course. All the contents in the future chapters will be based on these concepts.

1. **Computer Architecture**: _Attributes_ visible to a programmer, or attributes _have a direct impact on the execution_ of a program.
2. **Organization**: _Operational units and their interconnections_ that realize the architectural specifications.
3. **Structure**: The way in which the components are _interrelated_.

- Top level structure of the computer:

  <br/>
- Major Elements of a **Multi-core Computer**:

  <br/>
- CPU Structure:
  - Control Unit (CU): _Controls the operation of the CPU_.
  - Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU): _Performs arithmetic and logical operations_.
  - Registers internal to the CPU: _Hold intermediate results_.
  - CPU Interconnections

4. **Function**: _The operation_ of each individual component as part of a structure.

- Main functions:
  - Movement
  - Storage
  - Control (星形结构的中心)
  - Processing

## History of Computer Evolution

- Vacuum tubes: **IAS Structure**
- Transistors: Add _data channels_ to process I/O instructions.
- Integrated circuits: Add Gates and Cells to process digital signals, with the use of _Multiplexor_.
- VLSI, ULSI, Microprocessors

# Chapter 2

## Strive for performance!

There are 3 major ways for achieving high performance in the current workflow.

1. **Microprocessor Speed**, by _pipelining_ and _Branch Prediction_,etc.
2. **Performance Balance**, by _tuning the COA to compensate for the mismach between capabilities of the components_.
3. **Improvement in COA directly**: by enhancing the hardware speed of the processor, improving the _size and speed_ of the caches, or even change the overall structure of the processor.

# Chapter 4 (Part I)

## Computer Memory System

The complex subject of computer memory is made more manageable if we classify it according to its **characteristics**.

Here are the main characteristics of computer memory. Note that they are only a part of the whole picture.

{: .box-note}

- Overview of the Major Characteristics of Computer Memory System:<br/>
  - **Location**
  - **Capacity**
  - **Unit of Transfer**
  - **Access Method**
  - **Performance**
  - Physical Type
  - Physical Characteristics
  - Organization

Now we will move on to the details of each characteristic.

### **Location**

There are many different types of memory locations, but generally it can be classified into two types: - _Internal Memory_, including main memory, cache, internal memories at processor and control units, etc. - _External Memory_, consists of peripheral storage devices, such as disk and tape, that are accessible to the processor via I/O controllers.

### **Capacity**

Measured in _bytes_ or _words_, according to the type of memory. The concept of _word_ will soon be introduced.

### **Unit of Transfer**

{: .box-warning}
这里有几个概念需要区分：_word_,_address unit_,_unit of transfer_.<br/>对于*Word*,是最基础的存储单元，一般是 32bit 或者 64bit。**和“32 位、64位系统”里的概念等同**。<br/>对于*Address unit*，很多系统已经支持按位寻址，即地址是以字节为单位的，所以地址单元就是一个字节。但是，有的系统支持按字寻址，即地址是以字为单位的，所以地址单元就是一个字。<br/>对于*Unit of transfer*，一般和外部设备交换是以*block*为单位的，可以一次读取多个字。

### **Access Method**

This specifies how to access the unit of memory. There are **four** main access methods(顺序、直接、随机、相连内存访问):

- _Sequential Access_: The data is accessed in a linear fashion, one word at a time.
  - Devices using this method: _Tape_
  - Time to access a given location: **Not Constant**

{: .box-success}
_Memory is organized into units of data, called records. Access must be made in a specific linear sequence. Stored addressing information is used to separate records and assist in the retrieval process. A shared read– write mechanism is used, and this must be moved from its current location to the desired location, passing and rejecting each intermediate record. Thus, the time to access an arbitrary record is highly variable._

- _Direct Access_: The data is accessed directly by its address.
  - Devices using this method: _Disk_
  - Time to access a given location: **Not Constant**

{: .box-success}
_Individual blocks or records have a unique address based on physical location. Access is accomplished by direct access to reach a general vicinity plus sequential searching, counting, or waiting to reach the final location. Again, access time is variable._

- _Random Access_: The data is accessed randomly, without any specific order.
  - Devices using this method: _Main memory and some caches_
  - Time to access a given location: **Constant**

{: .box-success}
_Each addressable location in memory has a unique, physically wired in addressing mechanism. The time to access a given location is independent of the sequence of prior accesses and is constant. Thus, any location can be selected at random and directly addressed and accessed._

- _Associative_: Memory using such access method uses a **random access** type of memory that can make comparison of desired **bit** location rather than a **word** location. So it is a more delicate access method compared to random access.

  - Devices using this method: _Some Types of Cache_
  - Time to access a given location: **Constant**

### **Performance**

Mainly contains these aspects:

- _Access Time_, or _latency_
- _Memory Cycle Time_
- _Transfer Rate_

We will discuss them with random-access systems and non-random-access systems separately.

**For Random-Access Systems**

1. Access Time: 地址给到内存到被使用的时间。
2. Memory Cycle Time: 一次内存访问的时间，包括 Access Time 和 Data Transfer Time。
3. Transfer Rate: 单位时间内从内存到外部设备的传输速率。值为**1/Memory Cycle Time**，单位为 bps。

**For Non-Random-Access Systems**

1. Access Time: 读写寻址的时间。
2. Memory Cycle Time: 无此概念。
3. Transfer Rate: 单位时间内从内存到外部设备的传输速率。值为$$R$$。满足下面的式子：

$$T_n = T_{Access}+\frac{n}{R}$$

## Memory Hierarchy

The memory hierarchy is a hierarchical organization of memory devices, with each level providing faster access to the memory than the previous level.

The highest level (usually _Registers_),followed by _Caches_ and _main memory_ has the fastest access time, however they are expensive and limited in size. They are overall named as **inboard memory**.

Inboard memory is followed by **disks** and **tapes**, which are slower but have higher capacity and are suitable for long-term storage. External,nonvolatile memory is also referred to as **secondary memory** or **auxiliary memory**. They are visible to the user as files or records.


# Review Questions

## Questions

1. What are the differences among sequential, direct, and random access methods?
2. What is the general relationship among assess time, memory cost and capacity?
3. How does the principle of locality relate to the use of multiple memory levels?

## Answers

**Question 1:**

{: .box-note}
**Sequential access:** Memory is organized into units of data, called records. Access must be made in a specific linear sequence. **Direct access:** Individual blocks or records have a unique address based on physical location. Access is accomplished by direct access to reach a general vicinity plus sequential searching, counting, or waiting to reach the final location. **Random access:** Each addressable location in memory has a unique, physically wired-in addressing mechanism. The time to access a given location is independent of the sequence of prior accesses and is constant.

**Question 2:**

{: .box-note}
As access time becomes faster, the cost per bit increases. As memory size increases, the cost per bit is smaller. Also, with greater capacity, the access time becomes slower.

**Question 3:**

{: .box-note}
Slower and less expensive memory is used in higher stages, with the most expensive being the registers in the processor as well as cache. Main memory is slower, less expensive, and is outside of the processor.
