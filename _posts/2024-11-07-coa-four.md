This is a summary note of the course "Computer Organization and Architecture" by Professor _William Stallings_.

The remaining contents are organized as:

- Chapter 13
    - *Addressing Modes
    - *Instruction Format

# Chapter 13: Instruction Sets Addressing Modes and Format
## Addressing Modes
There are six typical addressing modes listed below.

- Immediate Addressing (立即数寻址)
- Direct Addressing (直接寻址)
- Indirect Addressing (间接寻址)
- Register Addressing (寄存器直接寻址)
- Register Indirect Addressing (寄存器间接寻址)
- Stack Addressing (栈寻址)

And here are some notations for convenience of the discussions below:

| Code | Meaning |
| :---: | :---: |
| A | contents of an address field in the instruction |
| EA | **E**ffective **A**ddress of the referenced instruction location |
| R | contents of an address field in the instruction that refers to a register |
| (X) | contents in address X |

Here's a brief summary of this.

### Immediate Addressing

Operand is a part of instruction.

**Pros**:
- Fast
- No memory reference to fetch data

**Cons**:
- limited range

### Direct Addressing

**EA = A**, where EA is the address of operand, A is a part of instruction. Instead of writing **operand** directly into the instruction field in immediate addressing, direct addressing method **put the address A into it**.

How it works: First add contents of cell A to the accumulator, then look at address EA to get the operand

**Pros**: 

- Single memory reference to access data
- No additional calculations to work out effective address

**Cons**:

- Limited address space

### Indirect Addressing

**EA = (A)**, which means the operand **address** lies in **content of A**. So the process is: Look in A, find address A and look there for the real address for operand.


**Pros**:
- Large Addressing Space

**Cons**:
- Multiple Memory Access Time
- Slower

### Register (Direct) Addressing

**EA = R**, which means the operand directly lies in somewhere in **a register**, where R means the address of operand in the register.

**Pros**:
- No memory access, hence faster
